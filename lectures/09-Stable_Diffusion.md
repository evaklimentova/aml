## Stable Diffusion

### Required Study Materials

[Stable Diffusion with Jeremy Howard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7rMfsA24Ls&ab_channel=JeremyHoward) -
The video is quite long and some parts are not necessary. So focus on the stable diffusion explanation (starting from Stable diffusion explained, 45:00) and you can skip the beginning part.

### Activities

#### 1. Discussion - what is hard for Stable Diffusion

It's pretty easy to get a beautiful picture from Stable Diffusion depicting *"Astronaut riding a horse"*.
But how hard ris to get a picture of *"Horse riding an astronaut"*? Let's try it out. 
Run any of the available instances of stable diffusion and try to get the best picture.
A painter would not have problem painting a picture like this, why Diffusion has? Think about it.

#### 2. Simulating Diffusion process

- take a paper with grid (each square represents a pixel) and draw there random black and white noise
- think about something that can be pictured on a small black&white pixel image and write it on the paper as a prompt for Diffusion (eg. cat, smiley face...)
- pass the image and label to the next group. Their task is to change max 7 pixels (revert its color) to get closer to the image label. This simulated the DIffusion process in the Stable Diffusion.
- repeat the previous point a couple of times. Do we already see on the picture what its label says?

#### 3. Quiz

Have a look at this [quiz](https://www.irozhlas.cz/veda-technologie/fotografie-obrazky-umela-inteligence-aplikace-rozdil_2304050600_pik). 
You will try to recognize which pictures are real and which generated with AI. How did you do? Is it easy or not? Let's discuss.

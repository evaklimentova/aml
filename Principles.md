## Guiding principles

The goal of this course to let people investigate AI/ML and understand how to apply them in their area of expertise. So, graduates
will know enough to work as "liason" between AI/ML and domain experts.

#### Transparency

This course is open and our goal is to have all activities and materials available for everyone. We plan to add also reasons that lead
us to include/exclude particular idea/activity/material. This should help with re-using our materials in other courses or by other
universities.

You are welcome to question any activity/materials and if you wish propose something different. Feel free to question us openly or in private.

#### Guide instead of Teacher

This course is not lead by "teacher" as usually defined. Machine learning is currently a very wide field and it is not possible to be
expert in all (or even majority) of them. It is very likely that at the end of this course, you will know more about specific niche than
lecturers. We are more like "mountain guide", you have to do the work but we are here to help you with our expertise.

You are welcome to know more than we know.

#### Curator instead of creator

We believe that there are enough available study materials prepared by experts. So we do not intend to create new ones unless 
we feel it very important. In order to help you which materials suits you
best, we will try to not repeat too often. Later in the course when you will find some of the materials unsuitable for you, feel
free to look at materials by someone who you previously liked. 

You are welcome to suggest new materials found by you.

#### Different background

This course is intentionally open for everyone who know at least a bit of programming. The different background allows us to have different
opinions and knowledge of the topic. We will work with topics from math, linguistic, computer vision, law or chemistry. Sometimes you will
be domain expert and sometimes you will not. In order to become good liason you will have to talk differently to different people and 
prepared activities should help you to improve also in this area. 

You are welcome to talk to your colleagues about their domain of expertise (and smalltalk as well). 

#### Non-competitivness in the class

We will do a lot of group activities but majority of them will be intentionally non competitive. There are no losers in course, think about
it as in sport team. Goalkeeper or defensman will not score but they are at least as important as the forward. The field of ML is so wide,
that you can choose position that suits you the best. We will do our best to show you the most common ones. 

Your projects will be so different that it will be hard to compare them as well. Is it harder to predict stock values or diagnose a person with illness. 
Honestly, we don't know and comparing those results will not bring us anything relevant.

You are welcome to do competitive activities, just check https://www.kaggle.com and compete against other teams.

#### Grading

Because of your different background, the grading of this course is not about how "good" you are in ML/AI. There will be a lot of tasks
that will require your time and energy during the term, so be prepared for it.


Grading is more about fulfilling requirements ([Grading page](Grading.md)) than evaluation of your level of understanding.

## Checklist Applied Machine Learning (at FF MUNI)

### Before the course starts
- [ ] propagation via community channels
  - [ ] discord FI
  - [ ] facebook "Study Group FI MUNI"
  - [ ] facebook "Filozofická fakulta MU Brno"
  - [ ] facebook "PLIŇáci"
- [ ] propagation via official channels
  - [ ] Red Hat channels
  - [ ] facebook "FI MUNI" (?difficult but if we can do it once, it will be repeatable?) 
- [ ] send email to previous students 
  - invite them come to guest lectures
  - ask them to spread info about course and emphase to tell the true (*so newcomers are not suprised*)
  - mention what will be different/better (*so they know that their feedback have value*) 

### After the course starts
- [ ] ask datacamp for free access for students (*usually it take less than week*)

### Before each session
- [ ] take a look at datacamp deadlines (*so we can ask students who are late*)
- [ ] watch materials again (*so we are on the same boat as students*)
- [ ] (optional) prepare activity to ensure that they have read/watch materials

### After each session
- [ ] enter activity points (AP) to information system
  - 1 AP per activity, add the name of the activity to notes
- [ ] (new) list of all activities "somewhere" and current maximum reachable AP (*in 2022, it was not clear how far are students from the maximum*)
- [ ] enter datacamp assignement
- [ ] send e-mail
  - send it one day later (*so students have time to recover a bit before new tasks*)
  - summary from last live session (describe activities ?and their reasoning?)
  - describe datacamp tasks with deadline (+2 weeks are default)
  - describe materials that should student read/watch
  - mention project milestone deadlines
  - give info about guest in advance (2 week & 1 week before)

### After the oral exam
- [ ] ask student for feedback
  - improvements
  - what was the worst/most boring/... activity
  - what she/he likes the most
  - is there something that was missing
